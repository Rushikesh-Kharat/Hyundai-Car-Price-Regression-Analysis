# Hyundai Car Price Regression Analysis

### **INTRODUCTION**

####  This repository comprises project files on - Predicting the Resale Value of Used Hyundai Cars which is a Regression Analysis performed using machine learning. The primary goals of the project were:

1. To understand the data and analyse the variables provided to predict the price of used Hyundai cars
2. To preprocess the data for futher analysis.
3. To visualise the data for correlation between the variables.
4. Create necessary machine learning models using python programming
5. Compare accuracies of different ML models and find the one with higher accuracy
6. Hyper-Parameter Tuning for accuracy improvement
7. Conclusion
